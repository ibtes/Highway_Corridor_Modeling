In this project, we analyzed existing operating conditions of a typical freeway section, then developed and evaluated control and operational improvements for the section. The analysis was performed with computer simulation techniques.

This project consists of three main parts:
- Model Verification & Calibration
- Impacts of Traffic Growth
- Development and Evaluation of Traffic Management Strategies
  - Ramp Metering
  - Incident Management Measures
  - Geometric and operational improvements
